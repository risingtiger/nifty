## TODOS
- SWC is writing out old format javascript and async/awaits being blown out into a custom state machine is fucking with readability on debug. Most likely swap it all out with Turbopack
- PWAPP (any sub app) has a package.json in appengine. And has redundant things like express etc. Need to either take out sub app appengine package.json entirely or make it DRYer
